Tell em you need it
Cause it's soothing to know
There's no end
Can you separate it
I know you want it
To feel control

No traffic in these eyes
When veins in tantric change
It's slow pumping through my legs
We'll try to carry on
With veins in tantric change
And yes we'll try
To stomp the days away

What if right now
These heads
Rolled dead across the table
Who'd sew theirs back?
I'm slowly thinking
Of switching your head
With my body
And we can start these days the same

Comfort me on the floor with these bones
They're two mouths to feed
I am just a ghost

You think i'm rested
I am more shot than you know
I hear and chase them off the rooftops and the walls
It feels like there's something in the walls

No traffic in my eyes
It takes the pain away
