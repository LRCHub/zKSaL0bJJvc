This one's for all the kids who never had a chance to live,
Constantly moving house to house, life abridged,
I thanked you for the days I planned to live again, but I don't want to live without you and I don't want to have to share you

This one's for all the guys who couldn't stand up for themselves, take that heart-shaped ring, throw it into the woods and run
There were days that I didn't know what to do
Someday we will forget about you
Today I will forget about you
