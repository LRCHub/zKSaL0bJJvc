All eyes on you
That's what you hear and it makes you feel alright
Yeah you're the one who loves to criticize
You never needed to apologize no not you

Yeah I want to be like you (2x) you're such a superstar (Superstar)

We all know who you are well it's alright to love yourself and it's alright cause you're killing me
It's alright we all love your pretty face
Secrets in the closet
You got the key and locked it tight
You don't remember what you did last night
But I bet you looked out of sight and you did alright

Yeah I want to be like you (2x) you're such a superstar (Superstar)
We all know who you are

Sometimes I don't have enough
I'm so tired and I'm out of luck and just when things start to get real bad
I look at you and it makes me glad 'cause
It's alright to love yourself and it's alright 'cause you're killing me
It's alright we all love your pretty face
Won't get you far a Secondhand Superstar

Yeah I want to be like you (2x) you're such a superstar (Superstar)
We all know who you are alright
I want to be like you (4x)
