How am I supposed to let you go?
How am I supposed to let you walk away?
How am I supposed to let you go?
You're all I ever wanted in my life
All I ever wanted in my
You're all I ever wanted in my
All I ever wanted in my life, life, life
You're all I ever wanted in my
You're all I ever wanted in my
(You're only, uh)
You're all I ever wanted in my
And I'm like, "What's up? What's up?" (Up)
Sippin' on Fanta (Yeah)
Black like Wakanda (Oh),
let me remind ya (Oh)
Rockin' designer,
racks in my binder
She my type of liner,
you will never find her
I would do the same
if I ain't have cash
and I had time for her
Who said we had to be
secondhand lovers? (Lover)
You know we play the game,
we need each other
Need each other
Angel dust (Angel dust)
Shawty always got me trippin'
like angel dust (Yo, angel dust)
Everywhere she goes,
you always see me,
I'm flockin', I'm flockin'
Shawty, you're stuck with me
like I'm stuck in your teeth, no flossin'
My phone gon' ring-ring,
I pull up in a GT (Yeah)
Wrap it first, easy,
all because she pretty
Her friends talkin' down on me,
she petty, she don't listen
She double down off the Hennessy,
she sluttin' me, she sluttin' me
Slap the devil and told him
that my girl hotter
(How am I supposed to let you go?)
If I'm way too tall, no, no,
with the way you whine, yo, yo
(How am I supposed to let you walk away?)
Who taught ya, who taught ya? (Ay)
Got my hands all on ya body
(How am I supposed to let you go? Ay)
Please don't break my heart
(You're all I ever wanted in my life)
You're all I ever wanted in my
(You're all I ever wanted, huh)
You're all I ever wanted in my
(You're only, uh)
You're all I ever wanted in my
And I'm like, "What's up? What's up?"
Sippin' on Fanta
Black like Wakanda,
let me remind ya (Oh)
Rockin' designer,
racks in my binder
She my type of liner,
you will never find her
I wouldn't do the same
if I ain't have cash
and I had time for her
Who said we had to be
secondhand lovers? (Lover)
You know we stay together,
we need each other
We need each other
This a Lamborghini,
baby, are you with me?
She do Bobby, Whitney,
that booty always tempting
Why are you here sipping?
I sing a whole symphony
I took her to the Gucci store
and walked out with some Tiffany
Now we in here singin'
all these love songs,
all these love songs
Girl, you gave me love, shawty,
swingin' in your undertone, yeah
You know I be in, yeah, on a mission,
I need you to get down and do that
Let's go, let's go, outside, outside
This here be my time,
she here like a hog tie
Let's go, let's go, outside, outside
A chopper outside,
my Black Hawk is outside
You're all I ever wanted in my
You're all I ever wanted in my
(You're only, uh)
You're all I ever wanted in my
And I'm like, "What's up? What's up?" (Up)
Sippin' on Fanta (Yeah)
Black like Wakanda (Oh),
let me remind ya (Oh)
Rockin' designer,
racks in my binder
She my type of liner,
you will never find her
How am I supposed to let you go?
How am I supposed to let you walk away?
How am I supposed to let you go?
You're all I ever wanted in my
